/**
 * The disadvantage of this inheritance mapping method is that retrieving entities
 * requires joins between tables, which can result in lower performance for large numbers of records.
 *
 * The number of joins is higher when querying the parent class
 * as it will join with every single related child â€“
 * so performance is more likely to be affected the higher up the hierarchy we want to retrieve records.
